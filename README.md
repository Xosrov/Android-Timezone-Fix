# Android-Timezone-Fix
Magisk module to fix timezone for Iran (GMT+3:30) and possibly other places.  
Uses up-to-date timezone data taken from [LineageOS](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_system_timezone/tree/lineage-20.0). Tested on Android 12+.

**WARNING**: Usage of this module is not recommended for Android versions below 11, as it may not work and might even cause [bootloops](https://github.com/Xosrov/Android-Timezone-Fix/issues/6). If you have had success with Android 11 in the past, please create an issue guidelining it so I can work on a patch.

## Installation
1. Download zip file from release section
2. Open magisk and tap the "Modules" tab
3. Tap the "Install from storage" and select zip file
4. Reboot
